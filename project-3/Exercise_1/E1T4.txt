Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
- The WebAppSG's Inbound rules has a rule which allow access to server from all traffic types, all ports, all protocols and any addresses then attacker can use them to attack the server

# Poor practice 2
- IAM role has full access to any bucket in S3. S3 buckets should use the correct policies and are not publicly accessible
